* Atlantis Water Meter Board
** How it works
   - get the water pulses by the four inputs
   - send the pulses to managing board (Rpi Hat) over RS485
   - check the inputs pairs intergrity and show states in the pulses led
   - check the RS-485 connection and show up state on link led

** Hardware Start [4/5]
   - [X] 4 channels LED outputs
   - [X] 4 channels pulses inputs
   - [X] link LED output
   - [X] ADC inputs for channels
   - [ ] Usart rs485 output


** Firmware [0/3]
   - [ ] ADC inputs thresholds
   - [ ] noise filter on digital inputs
   - [ ] usart to rs485 link comms


* Testing on Client Date DD-MM-YYYY
** some problem?
   - what was the detected problem
