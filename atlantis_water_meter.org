* Atlantis Water Meter Board
** How it works
   - get the water pulses by the four inputs
   - send the pulses to managing board (Rpi Hat) over RS485
   - check the inputs pairs intergrity and show states in the pulses led
   - check the RS-485 connection and show up state on link led

** Hardware Start [5/5]
   - [X] 4 channels LED outputs
   - [X] 4 channels pulses inputs
   - [X] link LED output
   - [X] ADC inputs for channels
   - [X] Usart rs485 output


** Firmware [3/3]
   - [X] ADC inputs thresholds
   - [X] noise filter on digital inputs
   - [X] usart to rs485 link comms


* Testing on Client Date DD-MM-YYYY
** some problem?
   - what was the detected problem

* Data
** a fireman hose 19liter/s
** the ekm metering SPWM-150 10liter/pulse
   - so two pulses per second when using for a fire
